/* Notice extracted from xxHash homepage :

xxHash is an extremely fast Hash algorithm, running at RAM speed limits.
It also successfully passes all tests from the SMHasher suite.

Comparison (single thread, Windows Seven 32 bits, using SMHasher on a Core 2 Duo @3GHz)

Q.Score is a measure of quality of the hash function.
It depends on successfully passing SMHasher test set.
10 is a perfect score.

A 64-bits version, named XXH64, is available since r35.
It offers much better speed, but for 64-bits applications only.
Name     Speed on 64 bits    Speed on 32 bits
XXH64       13.8 GB/s            1.9 GB/s
XXH32        6.8 GB/s            6.0 GB/s
